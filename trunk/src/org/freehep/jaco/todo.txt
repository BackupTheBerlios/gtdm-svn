- handle properly fully qualified names if needed....

JACO C++ Library

- Locks (needed for synchronization between threads) need to be implemented properly
  (currently commented out, otherwise code crashes)
- calling delete method from java should null out CPP pointer
- attempt to access proxy with null CPP pointer should throw an exception
- need to add support for starting JVM from C++
- Add optional base class for C++ classes. Should zero out CPP pointer in class destructor
