Document Type Definition (DTD) for the Gantt-Termin-Drift Manager (gtdmanager).
This file describes the format of the XML-Files in which project planing
data is stored.

An example for using this DTD follows:

Version: 1.3
Modifications:
  2005-02-17; MK; Corrections of several errors in the DTD. Credits go
    to Sebastion Boschert (Group 23) and Andreas Haufler (Group 20) for
    finding errors and correction the DTD.
  2005-02-18; MK; Extension of the DTD with properties and vendor
    identification. The extension was motivated by Andreas Haufler
    (Group 20).
  2005-02-18; MK; Correction of one error, that were introduced by
    the prior extension. Changing of the type of the id attribute
    of the activity tag to by of type CDATA instead of ID. This is 
    caused by the fact, that in each instance are the same ids for
    activities. Credits to Andreas Haufler for finding these two bugs.
  2005-03-23; MK; Moved start and end date of a project to an
    instance since it doesn't make sense to have fixed start and end
    dates for all instances of a project. This change was motivated
    by Daniel Thoma (Group 10).

<!--
The root element for gtdmanager files. A project is defined
by its name. The planing of a project
is done in instances. Attributes for a project are the vendors
id and the software version this file was written with.
-->
<!ELEMENT project (name, property*, instance+)>
<!ATTLIST project
	vendor-id CDATA #REQUIRED
	version CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
An instance is a schedule for this project. For each instance
a name and the creation-date when this instance was created is defined.
Additionaly the absolute start and end date is assigned to an
instnace to get the duration of the project.
-->
<!ELEMENT instance (name, creation-date, start-date, end-date, property*, activity+)>

<!--
An activity is a task or phase in a project. Each activity starts and
ends at given dates. A name and short name describes the activity.
Acitivities can depend on each other. An activity is identified by
an unique id. Nested activities are possible, nesting means, that
the enclosing activity spans all enclosed activity and can serve
therefore as a container.
-->
<!ELEMENT activity (name, short-name, 
		start-date, end-date, property*, dependency*, activity*)>
<!ATTLIST activity
	id CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
It is possible to define depencies between activities. Each dependency
refers an activities id and has a type. The type of the dependency can 
be one of begin-end, end-end, begin-begin, and end-begin. Type is read
as follows <this activity>-<reference activity>. For instance with
type begin-end: The referencing activity begins as soon as the 
referenced activity ends.
-->
<!ELEMENT dependency (property*)>
<!ATTLIST dependency
	type (begin-begin | begin-end | end-begin | end-end) #REQUIRED
	activity-id CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
A name which must be specified for a project, an instance, or an 
activity.
-->
<!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>

<!--
Short name which must be given for an activity.
-->
<!ELEMENT short-name (#PCDATA)>

<!--
Definition of some data tags. Each date tag contains three attributes:
date, month, and year. The date holds the number of the day, month the
number of the month, and year the year of the date. The ranges of the
date entries are as follows: date := 1..31, month := 1..12, and year :=
0..XXXX (as far as you want).
-->
<!ELEMENT creation-date EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST creation-date
	date CDATA #REQUIRED

	year CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!ELEMENT start-date EMPTY>

	year CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!ELEMENT end-date EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST end-date
	date CDATA #REQUIRED
	month CDATA #REQUIRED
	year CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
Properties are name value pairs that contain vendor specific
information. Properties can be applied to projects, instances,
activities, and dependencies. For parsing the settings of a
project the properties tags need not to be evaluated since
they are vendor specific.
